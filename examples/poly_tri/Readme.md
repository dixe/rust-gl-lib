# Triangulation of polygones.

## Background


The final goal is to be able to triangulate complex polygones with holes in them.
The original idea is to triangulate with regard to font rendering. Where a glyph is describes by a number. of curves. Either clockwise or counter clockwise, dependen on if the "outside" or "inside" of the curve is part of the glyph.

This example might be part of the library if it proves useful and turn out with a nice api.
